# Eva Lexer

Eva lexer is a small lexing library that aims to be BNF and EBFN compatible.

## Work in Progress

This library is semi-functional, its tested but is still missing some core concepts before it can be marked complete.
With this please use this with a grain of salt (if you must use this at all).

## Goals

* Make possible to parse languages (as optional modules)
* Output language tree in a transport format (such as `JSON`)
* Benchmark and performance test

## Testing

The make file provides the following rule to help with testing:

```sh
$ make test
```
